# LearnEmber

This project was created for me to save my progress as I learned the basics and how to work with ember.js. This code is all open-sourced. Have fun messing around with it. My learning here with ember.js through this program is done, however you can go through the files and examine the coding for yourself and learn that way if you want to.

### Update
I am going to archive this repo so if you want to use the code, I think copying and pasting it should still work. If you want to interact with the coding however, contact me and I'll try and get back to you as soon as possible.
